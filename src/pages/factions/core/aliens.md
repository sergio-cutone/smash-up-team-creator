Aliens love to mess with people, and they love to mess with other players even more. From bouncing minions back to players’ hands, to replacing bases in play, aliens are out to have a great time, at any planet’s expense.

Aliens are able to neutralize opponent minions in unorthodox ways, usually by returning minions to their hand, and to return your minions, allowing you to replay them again and again.
