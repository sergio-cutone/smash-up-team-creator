The Masters of Evil seek to control the world through any means! In addition to the VP rewards from bases, they've developed alternate methods of getting VPs, and they get stronger the more VPs they have. They are also good at destroying characters, to slow other players, and increase their strategic gain.

They focus on gaining extra victory points by performing certain tasks, more or less easy to fulfill, and gain benefits depending on the amount of victory points you have.
