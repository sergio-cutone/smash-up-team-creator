The Avengers faction assembles six mighty heroes whose different skills can handle any situation. Each has a signature action that can be used at any time, but is stronger when used with its hero. Though their numbers are few, they have several ways to cycle through their deck and recycle discarded cards to get what they need when they need it.

They feature a team of six unique characters of power 5, each associated with a unique action that has a regular effect and an additional or alternative effect when the corresponding character is in play.
