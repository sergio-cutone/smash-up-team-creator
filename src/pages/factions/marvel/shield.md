S.H.I.E.L.D. carefully monitors the world and stands ready to jump in to stop their foes. Its agents excel at both calling in extra characters for help and strengthening each other. Careful planning allows them to play cards in the right order to maximize their assets.

They are able to play several characters on the same base and get benefits, most often power boosts, for having several characters on the same base.
