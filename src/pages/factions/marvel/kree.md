The Kree are an advanced militaristic race who strike down their foes with ruthless efficiency. Their strengths are in extra action play, additional power, and card draw. Their cards can be deployed for either long-term advantage or for devastating combos.

They focus on playing extra actions, drawing cards, especially actions, and gaining power from playing actions.
