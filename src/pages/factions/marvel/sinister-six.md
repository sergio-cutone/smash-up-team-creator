The Sinister Six love to prey on weakness. They have many ways to make bases weak, and get many benefits from weaker bases. They have several base modifiers and ways to reuse them and their characters. Since they make base breaking easier, they need to be careful to have the most power there when it happens.

They focus on playing base modifiers, reducing the breakpoint of bases and getting advantages on bases with low breakpoints of 19 or less.
