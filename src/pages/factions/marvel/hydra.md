Cut off one head and two shall take its place! Hydra is not afraid of character destruction since it makes them stronger, especially when their leaders order it. Hydra characters can overrun a base, and since they have several ways to swell their numbers, it won't be long until they are ready for more conquests.

They specialize on destroying your own characters for benefits, especially playing multiple low-powered characters in one turn.
