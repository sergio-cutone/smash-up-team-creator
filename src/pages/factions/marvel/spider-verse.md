Web-slinging heroes from parallel universes have come together in a common fight to protect their neighborhoods. They specialize in swinging in before and after bases score to sway things in their favor -- as long as they have someone already there. But they can be even stronger when they join forces during their own turn, so they can be busy no matter whose turn it is.

They focus on cards that can be played either 'normally', i.e. by spending a free/regular or extra card play, or as Special cards during the scoring of bases, albeit in a weaker or more restrictive version than the normal play.
