The Ultimates patrol the universe looking for cosmic threats. They are strong in movement, and movement makes them stronger. They also work well together, so they can spread out, and then unite as a powerful team where the need is greatest.

They focus on moving around bases and triggering additional effects as a result of movement, mainly power boosts.
